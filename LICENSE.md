CtrlppCheck Licensing
=====================

The CtrlppCheck is primarily licensed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License version 3.

Each of its source code files contains a license declaration in its header.
Whenever a file is provided under an additional or different license than
GPLv3, this is stated in the file header. Any file that may lack such a
header has to be considered licensed under GPLv3 (default license).

If two licenses are specified in a file header, you are free to pick the one
that suits best your particular use case. You can also continue to use the
file under the dual license. When choosing only one, remove the reference to
the other from the file header.


License Usage
-------------

The default license GPLv3 shall be used unless valid reasons are provided for a
deviation.
